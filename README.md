## 🚧 This is a beta! 🚧

This app currently relies on testing oauth, and is _**not**_ notarized. To disable the warning that prevents you from running the app, run `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Daycal.app` in your terminal after copying the .dmg to your Applications folder. To sign in, you either need to be added to the official testing oauth, or create your own as mentioned below.

## Build

- Open `Daycal.xcodeproj` in Xcode
- Update OAuth values in `Sources/Daycal/GoogleOAuthConfig.swift`
  - You only need calendar readonly permissions
- Build + Run the `Daycal` target

_Built with [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai/) and GPT 5.2_
